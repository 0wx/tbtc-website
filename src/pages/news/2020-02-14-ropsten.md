tBTC is Open-Source and Live on Ropsten

The first release of tBTC is now live on Ropsten, the public Ethereum testnet.

To try minting your first TBTC, visit the
[reference dApp](http://dapp.test.tbtc.network). Make sure you're loaded up on
testnet bitcoin and Ropsten ether, and you can be the first TBTC whale
