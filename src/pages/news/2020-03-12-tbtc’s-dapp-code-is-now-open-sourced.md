The reference dApp for tBTC, which uses the tbtc.js library, is now open-sourced at <https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-dapp>. This makes it better and easier for integration partners to use tBTC, as it allows them to customize the dApp to fit their specific needs.

Note that the current state of this repository does not necessarily reflect the state deployed on Ropsten; deploys to Ropsten currently happen on a periodic basis and correspond to tagged releases.

tBTC is committed to open-sourcing as the best standard for transparency and security in DeFi. In that vein, we are currently working on a bug bounty program. Additional information will be posted as it is available.
